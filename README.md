## Project Description:
In Assignment 3, we applied what we learned about version control systems,
specifically Github, to create and effectively use a remote repository. 
By connecting our Github accounts to our Cloud9, we were able to practice
things like pushing files and committing. Finally, we summarized 5 interesting 
concepts on our index.html files in order to demonstrate proficiency.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control allows programmers to revisit specific versions of a file 
they have been working on over time.
2. Distributed version control systems like Github are used in order for clients
to restore the repository in the case that the server dies.
3. Repositories can either be created new, or cloned. The chosen method depends 
on whether you are making a new repository for yourself, or working on one that
already exists, perhaps with other people.
