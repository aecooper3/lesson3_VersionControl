            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is a system that allows programmers to recall specific versions of a file they are modifying, by recording changes over time. There have been local, centralized, and distributed version control systems methods. The concept of version control systems is interesting to me, because I have thought how nice it would be if there were something that existed that could do what it does since I began programming. Turns out, there is something, and I’m finally informed. Having knowledge of version control systems and how to use them will serve a great purpose in this course and in our future careers, as I am sure we will use them regularly to track our modifications.

                <span class="text-muted">What is Git?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git was created by the Linux development community in 2005 after Bitkeeper. It is a distributed version control system, which means that clients are able to fully mirror the repository on the server instead of checking out the latest snapshot. This is advantageous because, if the server dies, the repository can be restored from any client with access. I found this concept interesting, because I didn’t realize how much version control systems have evolved over time. Knowing how to use Git will indubitably be relevant in our course, since we are learning it early on, I assume it will be our means of recording modifications to our work.

                <span class="text-muted">The Three Main States</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A file in Git is able to reside in 3 main states, which are committed, modified, and staged. In the committed state, the data is stored in a local database. In the modified state, the file has been change, but has not yet been committed to the database. In the staged state, a file has been marked in its current version to go into the next commit snapshot. I initially skipped over this reading by accident, moving forward I found myself very confused. After going back and finding it, I realize how important it is to understand the three main states, and that is why I find the concept crucial – as well as interesting. It is relevant to our course because, without this knowledge, it would be quite difficult to navigate Git.

                <span class="text-muted">Basic Git Workflow</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The basic workflow of Git is as follows: modify the files in your working tree, selectively stage the changes that will be part of the next commit to add those changes to the staging area, commit to store the snapshot permanently to the Git directory. I found this concept interesting because, although it was not given its own section, it is important to understand the process of committing, modifying, and staging files in addition to just knowing the states themselves. I anticipate referencing this frequently as I make my way through this course to be sure that I am modifying, committing, and staging changes correctly and when it is necessary.

                <span class="text-muted">Git Repositories Two Ways</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two ways to obtain a Git repository, you can either take a local directory that is not under version control and turn it into one, or you can clone an existing one from somewhere else. Depending on whether you are trying to create your own, or access another, you will choose one of these options. For a new repository, the command is git commit, and to clone a repository, the command is git clone. This was interesting to me, because I did not know cloning repositories to collaborate was an option and it seems like a clever feature. I anticipate that we will need to know how to obtain a repository using both of these ways at some point during this course.
